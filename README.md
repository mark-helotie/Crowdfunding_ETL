# Project #2 for Data Analysis bootcamp
## Team 5 --- Luis Pineda, Marshal Rockafellow, Mark Helotie
  
For the ETL mini project, you will work with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data.  After you transform the data, you'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, you’ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.


The instructions for this mini project are divided into the following subsections:

•	Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames	30/100

•	Create the Campaign DataFrame				30/100

•	Create the Contacts DataFrame				15/100

•	Create the Crowdfunding Database				25/100

Attribution is providing acknowledgement to the source of the information (text, image, dataset, etc.) you are using. Regardless of whether the referenced source is in the public domain, it is valuable to include attribution, to give authority to your information as well as to offer a source path that allows the reader to learn more. If you must clear permission from the source owner to include the information in your work, often the source owner will provide you with specific language to copy and paste verbatim as your attribution. If no specific language is requested/required by the source owner, attribution should usually include the creator and title of the work, the date created, and where the work can be found. Do not confuse attribution with citation... citation names the sources used within your work; attribution gives credit to the source holder for using their intellectual property.
